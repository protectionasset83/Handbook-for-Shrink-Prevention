  "rules": [
    "We verify the case link and store are correct before reviewing the transaction.",
    "We confirm whether suspected items were brought into the store or are personal by reviewing entry and other relevant cameras before flagging.",
    "We search 3.4 for the correct transaction and review scans, removals, and quantity edits across nearby registers or terminals to confirm payment or legitimate corrections before marking loss.",
    "We evaluate recall or suspended transactions based on what the camera shows at the time the transaction is recalled and completed with the item present.",
    "We use Product Multiple Detections when the same item is detected repeatedly, and we use Product Detected as Several Products when one item is split into multiple detections.",
    "We use Multiple SKUs in One Package only when one packaged product contains multiple sub-items that CV counts individually.",
    "We use Item Not in Transaction Area when detections occur outside the transaction area or within an exclusion zone.",
    "We use Static Items in the Transaction Area when detections are caused by stationary non-merchandise items or leftovers from a prior customer.",
    "We use Pay Screen when scans occur in payment mode and do not add items to the transaction, and we use Pay by Scan Error only for Pay by Scan system issues.",
    "We use Scan with Prompt on Screen when a prompt such as a protection plan is on screen and the scan does not add the item to the transaction.",
    "We use Failed to Scan when a customer attempts to scan an item but the scan does not register.",
    "We use Item Detected but Not Counted when the item is visible in tracklet photos but is not counted in the items detected quantity.",
    "We use Associate Gave Away only when an associate bags or hands over an item without adding it to the transaction.",
    "We use I Agree That There Is No Discrepancy only when the items detected count matches the physical items present and all items are correctly identified.",
    "We use Unknown Reason only when no other reason code applies and the transaction snapshot does not indicate what was detected.",
    "We confirm an item is sellable merchandise and not a sample, giveaway, empty packaging, or other non-merchandise object before flagging.",
    "We use Customer Brought In Matching Item when a personal item resembles store merchandise and appears to have been brought in, and we use Non-Lowe’s Personal Item Present only when it is clearly non-merchandise.",
    "We verify that the unscanned item matches the scanned item before assuming a quantity or substitution issue.",
    "We mark no loss when the suspected loss occurs outside the transaction window and record the relevant time for follow-up.",
    "We confirm the loss slider is set correctly before finalizing a flag because it can reset during the workflow.",
    "We cross-reference prior related cases to avoid duplicate flagging on the same customer or incident.",
    "We list every detected item that contributes to the discrepancy so potential loss is not missed.",
    "We confirm item quantity using the clearest camera angle and avoid estimating counts when visibility is unclear.",
    "We verify that items with similar appearance but different sizes, types, or SKUs are not assumed to be the same product.",
    "We confirm whether multiple identical items are present before marking a quantity mismatch.",
    "We mark no loss when video evidence does not clearly support an unscanned or unpaid item.",
    "We validate that detected items are physically handled by the customer and not background or shelf items before flagging.",
    "We verify the correct case and transaction are selected before reviewing video or transaction data.",
    "We confirm whether any suspected item was already in the customer’s possession at entry before marking loss.",
    "We continue video review past checkout to confirm whether suspected items leave the store, are returned, or belong to another customer.",
    "We check nearby, prior, or department transactions for the same item before flagging, including rentals, special orders, online pickups, and separate purchases.",
    "We use item identifiers and product attributes to search transaction history and do not rely on payment method to confirm purchase.",
    "We confirm an object is sellable merchandise and not packaging, tags, manuals, display material, store-issued supplies, clinic packets, cart parts, or empty boxes before flagging loss.",
    "We confirm whether an item is legitimately free or promotional and verify the transaction reflects the correct zero price or discount before flagging loss.",
    "We confirm included components and sold unit definitions from the product description when parts, bundles, or cut-to-length goods affect counting.",
    "We verify item identity by size, type, and packaging and avoid assuming visually similar items are the same SKU.",
    "We count quantities only when items are clearly visible and avoid overcounting when items are folded, cut, stacked, or partially obscured.",
    "We use Stacked Items when overlapping or obstructed items prevent reliable detection or counting.",
    "We use Item Out of View when the item is not visible during the snapshot window and Item Detected but Not Counted only when the item is visible but the system quantity is missing.",
    "We use Pay Screen when the register is in payment mode and additional scans cannot add items to the transaction.",
    "We use Nudge Screen when an on-screen prompt prevents a scan from being accepted.",
    "We use Invalid UPC when a scan triggers an invalid message and the item is not successfully added or is removed from the transaction.",
    "We confirm we are reviewing the correct customer and transaction and do not mix events from other customers or prior transactions.",
    "We verify suspected unpaid items by checking the transaction line items in the same, prior, and next transactions across all registers, departments, and service or pickup terminals before flagging loss.",
    "We continue video review through exit or item return to shelf to confirm the final disposition of suspected items.",
    "We select the single primary reason code that best explains the discrepancy and recode when the root cause differs from the initial selection.",
    "We require any replacement or exchange item leaving the store to be recorded as a transaction line item even at zero price.",
    "We describe scan behavior as observed in the video without implying intent and do not flag loss when the transaction shows no loss.",
    "We verify and document online pickup items using pickup-area cameras, pickup stickers, and 3.4 pickup records before treating them as unpaid.",
    "We use EPP Prompt when an item is scanned during an extended protection plan prompt and does not register.",
    "We use MLR Loyalty Entry when MyLowe’s Rewards entry interrupts scanning and the item does not register.",
    "We complete all assigned register reviews for the full day before moving to another register.",
    "We avoid flagging a discrepancy when item identity cannot be reliably determined and evidence does not support a specific unpaid item.",
    "We verify item identity using item description or identifier rather than packaging appearance when packaging changes occur.",
    "We verify whether an order number or department estimate was recalled and paid at checkout before flagging a special order item as unpaid.",
    "We confirm the exact items leaving match the reviewed transaction and do not assume payment based only on a similar receipt.",
    "We flag ticket switching when the scanned item description or size does not match the item in hand.",
    "We select the primary loss reason code that covers the largest quantity of missed items.",
    "We differentiate item variants within a box, such as single-pole versus two-pole breakers, when confirming quantities."
